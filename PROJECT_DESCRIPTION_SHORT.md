# PropAI - Intelligent Property Management System

PropAI automates tenant application processing and maintenance management. For applications, it receives emails via Agentmail webhooks, downloads attachments (driver's licenses, pay stubs, credit reports), and uses Google Gemini AI vision models to extract structured data like credit scores, income, and employment information. It calculates screening scores (green/yellow/red) based on credit score and income-to-rent ratios, automatically approves all applicants, and sends personalized approval emails. For tenant communication, tenants text via Twilio SMS and the AI assistant (powered by Gemini) is lease-aware, using processed lease documents to answer questions about rent amounts, payment schedules, security deposits, pet policies, and lease terms. It also responds with troubleshooting steps, analyzes images of issues, and automatically creates maintenance tickets with priority classification (critical/high/normal) based on keywords like "overflowing" or "broken". All applications and tickets are saved to PostgreSQL. The real-time Next.js dashboard polls every 3 seconds, displaying applications with color-coded status badges, credit score highlighting, and an activity feed. Built with FastAPI, Next.js, Agentmail, Twilio, and Gemini 2.0 Flash, the system automates tenant screening, lease-aware SMS communication, and maintenance ticket creation through AI-powered email and SMS processing.
