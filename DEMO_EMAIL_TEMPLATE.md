**Body:**

```
Hi there,

I'm interested in applying for the rental property at 123 Main Street.

My name is John Smith and I'm currently looking for a new apartment. I have excellent credit and a stable income that well exceeds the rent requirements.

Here are my details:
- Name: John Smith
- Email: john.smith.demo@example.com
- Phone: 555-123-4567
- Current Employment: Software Engineer at TechCorp
- Annual Income: $90,000
- Credit Score: 750

I can provide my driver's license, pay stubs, and credit report upon request.

I'm very interested in scheduling a showing as soon as possible. Please let me know what times work for you.

Thank you for your consideration!

Best regards,
John Smith

## Why This Will Rank in Top 3

- **Credit Score:** 750 (excellent - will rank high)
- **Income:** $90,000/year = $7,500/month (3.75x $2,000 rent - very strong)
- **Income Ratio:** 3.75x rent (exceeds 3x threshold)
- **Complete Documents:** All 3 required documents

This applicant will likely rank **#1 or #2** among all 16 applications, triggering auto-scheduling!

## Alternative: Lower Quality Applicant (for comparison)

If you want to show a rejected/lower-ranked applicant:

```
Hi,

I'm interested in applying for the rental property.

Name: Jane Doe
Email: jane.doe@example.com
Phone: 555-987-6543
Income: $45,000/year

I've attached my documents.

Thanks!
Jane Doe
```

This would have:
- Lower credit score (~580)
- Lower income ($3,750/month = 1.875x rent)
- Would rank lower and get rejection email

**What Happens:**
1. System receives email via Agentmail
2. Detects missing documents
3. Sends email requesting documents (optional - you can skip this step for demo)
4. Still processes application with provided info (credit score, income in email body)
5. Queries Hyperspell to rank
6. If top-ranked, auto-schedules showing

**Note:** Even without attachments, the system can still process the application using the info in the email body (credit score, income). For full processing, add documents later if needed.
